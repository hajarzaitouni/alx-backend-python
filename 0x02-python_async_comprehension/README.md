# Python - Async Comprehension
In modern Python, asynchronous programming is a powerful tool for writing concurrent code. Two key components of this are __asynchronous generators__ and __async comprehensions__.

## General
In this project we were able to learn about:
* How to write an asynchronous generator.
* How to use async comprehensions.
* How to type-annotate generators.
