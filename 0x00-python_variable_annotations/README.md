# Python - Variable Annotations
This project focuses on understanding and implementing variable annotations in Python. By the end of this project, we will be able to explain and utilize type annotations, specify function signatures and variable types, understand duck typing, and validate the code using `mypy`.

## General
At the conclusion of this project, we will be able to:

* Type annotations in Python 3: Explain what type annotations are and how they are used in Python.
* Specify function signatures and variable types: Use type annotations to clearly define the types of function parameters, return values, and variables.
* Duck typing: Understand the concept of duck typing and its implications in Python.
* Validate your code with mypy: Use the mypy tool to check your code for type consistency and correctness.
